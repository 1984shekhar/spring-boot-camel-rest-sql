# Spring Boot Camel REST / SQL QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to use SQL via JDBC along with Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API.

This example relies on the [Fabric8 Maven plugin](https://maven.fabric8.io) for its build configuration.

### Building

The example can be built with:

    $ mvn install

### Running the example locally

The example can be run locally using the following Maven goal:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively, you can run the application locally using the executable JAR produced:

    $ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev target/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

This uses an embedded in-memory HSQLDB database. You can use the default Spring Boot profile in case you have a MySQL server available for you to test.

You can then access the REST API directly from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books>
- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1>

### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed a OpenShift platform is already running.

Besides, it is assumed that a MySQL service is already running on the platform. You can deploy it using the provided deployment by executing in OpenShift:

    $ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/db-templates/mysql-ephemeral-template.json
    $ oc new-app --template=mysql-ephemeral

More information can be found in [using the MySQL database image](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/using_images/db_images/mysql.html). You may need to pass `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true` as environment variable to the deployment.

The example can then be built and deployed using a single goal:

    $ mvn fabric8:run -Dmysql-service-username=<username> -Dmysql-service-password=<password>

The `username` and `password` system properties correspond to the credentials
used when deploying the MySQL database service.

You can use the OpenShift client tool to inspect the status, e.g.:

- To list all the running pods:
    ```
    $ oc get pods
    ```

- Then find the name of the pod that runs this example, and output the logs from the running pod with:
    ```
    $ oc logs <pod_name>
    ```

### Running via an S2I Application Template

Applicaiton templates allow you deploy applications to OpenShift by filling out a form in the OpenShift console that allows you to adjust deployment parameters.  This template uses an S2I source build so that it handle building and deploying the application for you.

First, import the Fuse image streams:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/fis-2.0.x.redhat/fis-image-streams.json

Then create the quickstart template:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/fis-2.0.x.redhat/quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-template.json

Now when you use "Add to Project" button in the OpenShift console, you should see a template for this quickstart. 


### Accessing the REST service

When the example is running, a REST service is available to list the books that can be ordered, and as well the order statuses.

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you. Add the `-Dfabric8.deploy.createExternalUrls=true` option to your Maven commands if you want it to deploy a Route configuration for the service.

The actual endpoint is using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/books` and the REST service provides two services:

- `books`: to list all the available books that can be ordered,
- `order/{id}`: to output order status for the given order `id`.

The example automatically creates new orders with a running order `id` starting from 1.

You can then access these services from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://qs-camel-rest-sql.vagrant.f8/camel-rest-sql/books>
- <http://qs-camel-rest-sql.vagrant.f8/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1>

### Swagger API

The example provides API documentation of the service using Swagger using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/api-doc`. You can access the API documentation from your Web browser at <http://qs-camel-rest-sql.vagrant.f8/camel-rest-sql/api-doc>.
